# Automatic-Railway-Gate-Controlling-System 
## Introduction

The **Automatic Railway Gate Controlling System** is an embedded automation project designed to enhance the safety and efficiency of railway level crossings. Traditionally, railway gates are operated manually by gatekeepers, which introduces human error, delays, and the risk of accidents due to miscommunication or negligence.

This system proposes an automated solution where railway gates are controlled using sensors and microcontrollers. It detects the presence of an approaching train and automatically closes the gate before the train arrives at the crossing. Once the train has passed safely, the gate reopens without the need for human intervention.

The objective is to reduce accidents at unmanned or semi-manned level crossings by ensuring that gates operate precisely and reliably in real-time. The system can be further integrated with alert mechanisms such as buzzer alarms and signal lights for enhanced safety.

This project is ideal for deployment in rural or high-risk areas where manual supervision is limited or ineffective.
